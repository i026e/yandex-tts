        <title><p>CHAPTER I. MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES.</p></title>
        <p>IN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the
          University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the
          course prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my
          studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland
          Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India
          at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had
          broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had
          advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy's
          country. I followed, however, with many other officers who were in
          the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in
          safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new
          duties.</p>
        <p>The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it
          had nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my
          brigade and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the
          fatal battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a
          Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian
          artery. I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis
          had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my
          orderly, who threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing
          me safely to the British lines.</p>
